# Playground Test Cases

This folder contains files to test the **Autodetect Generated Files** extension.

| File | Expected Result | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `detected_by_header.js` | **Read-only** | Contains `// @autogenerated` in the first line. |
| `detected_by_gitattributes.ts` | **Read-only** | Marked as `generated` in `.gitattributes`. |
| `manual_file.md` | **Editable** | Written manually, no triggers. |

## How to Test

1. Ensure the extension is running (F5).
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Open `detected_by_header.js` or `detected_by_gitattributes.ts`.
4. Verify that VS Code displays a lock icon in the tab and a "The editor is read-only" warning bar at the top.
5. Try to type in the file to confirm it is protected.
